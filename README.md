## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **MineTurtlee**!
I'm a student and a hobbyist developer who build things (patched or non-patched) to use for some things.
I know how to write code in:
- CSS
- HTML (I suck at this and the one above)
- Python (Though I also suck but I do know basic stuff)
- C# (Oh no, I suck at this.)

In the meantime, when I am free and feel bored, I also *hackintosh*! (time to go get a Mac)
I also own **[Actionizer](https://github.com/Actionizer)**
